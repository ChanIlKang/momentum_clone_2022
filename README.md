HTML, CSS, Javascript

The languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This is a simple app for creating to do list.
I made this app to make to do list.

This app can do these things.
1. Create to-do list that user write.
2. Deleate to-do list that user selected.
3. Show good quotes randomly at the bottom of screen.
